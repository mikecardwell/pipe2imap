Pipe2IMAP is a Perl script that will take IMAP options from the command line
arguments, and an email from a PIPE, and will deliver the message via in IMAP
APPEND operation. It relies on a single third party Perl module to be installed
from CPAN named IMAP::Client.

Example 1: Deliver an email to a users inbox:

   cat email.txt|pipe2imap.pl --user username --pass password --folder "INBOX"

Example 2: A more complicated example. You want to deliver an email to a folder
in the account belonging to "user1". The folder is called "FolderForUser2" and
"user2" has read only access to this folder. You want the folder to be created
automatically if it doesn't exist. You want to mark the message as already seen.

   cat email.txt|pipe2imap.pl --user user1 --pass password --folder "FolderForUser2" --create user2=lrs --flags '\seen'

Run the application with no arguments to see a description of all of the options.
